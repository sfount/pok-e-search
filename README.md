# Pokésearch

Simple web service to search for and favourite Pokémon.

Core technologies:
* Reactjs
* Redux
* TypeScript
* TypeScript backend

Proposed improvements with additional time:
* CSP to ensure image resources are only loaded from trusted sources
* Happy path end to end journey testing across both the frontend and the backend (using [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/))
